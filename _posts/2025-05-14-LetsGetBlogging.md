# Hello, GitHub! 👋

I’m Dan, a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) by day and curious tinkerer by night. Today marks a small but exciting milestone: my very first GitHub post!

## Why GitHub?

As an SRE, I spend my days designing systems that stay up, stay fast, and stay secure. GitHub has been my go-to for collaboration, version control, and open-source inspiration. But until now, I’ve only been a consumer—cloning repos, filing issues, and merging pull requests.

## The Spark

Last week, while debugging a tricky Kubernetes rollout, I realized the fix I crafted might help others. I cleaned up my scripts, wrote some notes, and thought: “Why not share this?”

## What I Posted

- **A small Bash script** that simplifies rolling back a failed deployment  
- **Usage examples** and basic error checking  
- **A README** explaining when and how to use it  

You can find it here: [github.com/alex-sre/rollback-helper](https://github.com/alex-sre/rollback-helper)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Clear README matters:** I spent more time writing instructions than writing code.  
2. **Commit early, commit often:** Small commits made it easy to iterate.  
3. **Community welcomes newbies:** Within hours, someone opened a suggestion to improve logging—so helpful!

## What’s Next?

This post is just the beginning. I plan to:

- Add tests and CI checks  
- Build a small demo using Docker  
- Share more SRE tips and scripts  

Thank you for reading! If you’re also just starting on GitHub, drop a comment or open an issue—I’d love to connect.
